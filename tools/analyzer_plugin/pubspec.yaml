  # Upon release, this should be pinned to the over_react version from ../../pubspec.yaml
  # so that it always resolves to the same version of over_react that the user has pulled in,
  # and thus has the same boilerplate parsing code that's running in the builder.

# If you're developing on changes in over_react that the analyzer plugin needs to consume,
# point to the local copy of over_react. This must be an absolute path.

# In CI, this should also be the path to the over_react checkout
