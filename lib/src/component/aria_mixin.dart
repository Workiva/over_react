  /// causes a given element to be treated as having no role or to be removed from the accessibility
  /// tree, but does not cause the content contained within the element to be removed from the accessibility tree.

  /// The presentation role is used on an element that has implicit native semantics, meaning that
  /// there is a default accessibility API role for the element. Some elements are only complete

  /// the grid role) require tr descendants (the row role), which in turn require th or td children
  /// (the gridcell, columnheader, rowheader roles). Similarly, lists require list item children.
  /// The descendant elements that complete the semantics of an element are described in WAI-ARIA as
  /// required owned elements.
  ///
  /// When an explicit or inherited role of presentation is applied to an element with the implicit
  /// semantic of a WAI-ARIA role that has required owned elements, in addition to the element with
  /// the explicit role of presentation, the user agent MUST apply an inherited role of presentation
  /// to any owned elements that do not have an explicit role defined. Also, when an explicit or
  /// inherited role of presentation is applied to a host language element which has required children
  /// as defined by the host language specification, in addition to the element with the explicit role
  /// of presentation, the user agent MUST apply an inherited role of presentation to any required
  /// children that do not have an explicit role defined. For any element with an explicit or inherited
  /// role of presentation and which is not focusable, user agents MUST ignore role-specific WAI-ARIA states
  /// and properties for that element. For example, in HTML, a ul or ol element with a role of presentation
  /// will have the implicit native semantics of its li elements removed because the list role to which
  /// the ul or ol corresponds has a required owned element of listitem. Likewise, although an HTML table
  /// element does not have an implicit native semantic role corresponding directly to a WAI-ARIA role,
  /// the implicit native semantics of its thead/tbody/tfoot/tr/th/td descendants will also be removed,
  /// because the HTML specification indicates that these are required structural descendants of the
  /// table element. Explicit roles on a descendant or owned element override the inherited role of
  /// presentation, and cause the owned element to behave as any other element with an explicit role.
  /// If the action of exposing the implicit role causes the accessibility tree to be malformed, the
  /// expected results are undefined and the user agent MAY resort to an internal recovery mechanism
  /// to repair the accessibility tree.
  ///
  /// Note: Only the implicit native semantics of elements that correspond to WAI-ARIA required owned
  /// elements are removed. All other content remains intact, including nested tables or lists, unless
  /// those elements also have a explicit role of presentation applied.
  ///
  /// For any element with an explicit or inherited role of presentation, user agents MUST apply
  /// an inherited role of presentation to all host-language-specific labeling elements for the presentational
  /// element. For example, a table element with a role of presentation will have the implicit native

  /// table.
