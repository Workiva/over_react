  /// updated accordingly when an element is shown or hidden, unless the intent of using off-screen
  /// positioning is to make the content visible only to screen reader users and not others.
  ///
  /// Authors MAY, with caution, use aria-hidden to hide visibly rendered content from assistive
  /// technologies only if the act of hiding this content is intended to improve the experience
  /// for users of assistive technologies by removing redundant or extraneous content. Authors using
  /// aria-hidden to hide visible content from screen readers MUST ensure that identical or equivalent
  /// meaning and functionality is exposed to assistive technologies.
  ///
  /// Note: Authors are advised to use extreme caution and consider a wide range of disabilities
  /// when hiding visibly rendered content from assistive technologies. For example, a sighted,
  /// dexterity-impaired individual may use voice-controlled assistive technologies to access a
  /// visual interface. If an author hides visible link text "Go to checkout" and exposes similar,
  /// yet non-identical link text "Check out now" to the accessibility API, the user may be unable
  /// to access the interface they perceive using voice control. Similar problems may also arise
  /// for screen reader users. For example, a sighted telephone support technician may attempt to
  /// have the blind screen reader user click the "Go to checkout" link, which they may be unable
  /// to find using a type-ahead item search ("Go to…").

  /// If an element is only visible after some user action, authors MUST set the aria-hidden attribute
  /// to true. When the element is presented, authors MUST set the aria-hidden attribute to false
  /// or remove the attribute, indicating that the element is visible. Some assistive technologies
  /// access WAI-ARIA information directly through the DOM and not through platform accessibility
  /// supported by the browser. Authors MUST set aria-hidden='true' on content that is not displayed,
  /// regardless of the mechanism used to hide it. This allows assistive technologies or user agents
  /// to properly skip hidden elements in the document.
  ///
  /// It is recommended that authors key visibility of elements off this attribute, rather than
  /// change visibility and separately have to remember to update this property. CSS 2 provides
  /// a way to select on attribute values (`CSS`). The following CSS declaration makes content visible
  /// unless the aria-hidden attribute is true; scripts need only update the value of this attribute
  /// to change visibility:
  ///
  /// [aria-hidden='true'] { visibility: hidden; }
  ///
  /// Note: Authors are reminded that visibility:hidden and display:none apply to all CSS media
  /// types; therefore, use of either will hide the content from assistive technologies that access
  /// the DOM through a rendering engine. However, in order to support assistive technologies that
  /// access the DOM directly, or other authoring techniques to visibly hide content (for example,
  /// opacity or off-screen positioning), authors need to ensure the aria-hidden attribute is always
  /// updated accordingly when an element is shown or hidden, unless the intent of using off-screen
  /// positioning is to make the content visible only to screen reader users and not others.
  ///
  /// Authors MAY, with caution, use aria-hidden to hide visibly rendered content from assistive
  /// technologies only if the act of hiding this content is intended to improve the experience
  /// for users of assistive technologies by removing redundant or extraneous content. Authors using
  /// aria-hidden to hide visible content from screen readers MUST ensure that identical or equivalent
  /// meaning and functionality is exposed to assistive technologies.
  ///
  /// Note: Authors are advised to use extreme caution and consider a wide range of disabilities
  /// when hiding visibly rendered content from assistive technologies. For example, a sighted,
  /// dexterity-impaired individual may use voice-controlled assistive technologies to access a
  /// visual interface. If an author hides visible link text "Go to checkout" and exposes similar,
  /// yet non-identical link text "Check out now" to the accessibility API, the user may be unable
  /// to access the interface they perceive using voice control. Similar problems may also arise
