# `web_skin_dart` Transformer

[](#__START_EMBEDDED_README__)

Web Skin Dart components are declared using a set of [annotations] which are picked up by a Pub transformer.

This transformer generates code, wiring up the different pieces of component declarations and creating typed getters/setters for props and state.

This allows boilerplate to be significantly reduced, making the code you right much cleaner and more grokkable.

Comprehensive component declaration [examples] are available in the `examples/` directory.

## Wiring it all up
__Be sure to familiarize yourself with the [core component framework] first.__

The transformer wires up your factory, props class, and component class so that you don't have to!

Let's walk through the transformation process for a component.

First, let's declare a component.

```dart
@Factory()
UiFactory<FooProps> Foo;

@Props()
class FooProps extends UiProps { ... }

@Component()
class FooComponent extends UiStatefulComponent<FooProps, FooState> {
  @override
  render() { ... }
}
```

Note that we've annotated our component pieces with `@Factory`, `@Props`, and `@Component`. These are what the transformer uses as hooks to find your component.

Okay, so we've defined our component. Let's look at what the transformer does.

First, implementations of the props/component classes are generated, since the classes we defined in our code have stubbed methods and don't have constructors.

```dart
// Concrete props implementation.
//
// Implements constructor and backing map, and links up to generated component factory.
class _$FooPropsImpl extends FooProps {
  /// The backing props map proxied by this class.
  @override
  final Map props;

  _$FooPropsImpl(Map backingMap) : this.props = backingMap ?? ({});

  /// Let [UiProps] internals know that this class has been generated.
  @override
  bool get $isClassGenerated => true;

  /// The [ReactComponentFactory] associated with the component built by this class.
  @override
  Function get componentFactory => _$FooComponentFactory;

  /// The default namespace for the prop getters/setters generated for this class.
  @override
  String get propKeyNamespace => 'FooProps.';
}

// Concrete component implementation.
//
// Implements typed props/state factories, defaults `consumedPropKeys` to the keys
// generated for the associated props class.
class _$FooComponentImpl extends FooComponent {
  /// Let [UiComponent] internals know that this class has been generated.
  @override
  bool get $isClassGenerated => true;

  /// The default consumed prop keys, taken from FooProps.
  /// Used in [UiProps.consumedPropKeys] if [consumedPropKeys] is not overridden.
  @override
  final List<List<String>> $defaultConsumedPropKeys = const [FooProps.$propKeys];

  @override
  FooProps typedPropsFactory(Map backingMap) => new _$FooPropsImpl(backingMap);
}
```

Note that the `typedPropsFactory` variable is wired up to use the props implementation class's constructor. This lets us get an instance of that class when we use the `props` getter and the `newProps()` method.

Next, the component is registered with the React Dart wrapper, using the component implementation class.

```dart
// React component factory implementation.
//
// Registers component implementation and links type meta to builder factory.
final _$FooComponentFactory = registerComponent(() => new _$FooComponentImpl(),
    builderFactory: Foo,
    componentClass: FooComponent,
    isWrapper: false,
    displayName: 'Foo'
);
```

Finally, it initializes the factory variable with a function that returns a new instance of our private props implementation. This factory is the __the entrypoint__ to externally consuming our component and props class.

```diff
@Factory()
-UiFactory<FooProps> Foo;
+UiFactory<FooProps> Foo = ([Map backingProps]) => new _$FooPropsImpl(backingProps);
```


Again, this all goes on under the hood, but you can see it in action for your own components using the [transformer diff view](#debugging-with-the-diff-view).

## Props and state Getters/Setters

Writing a strongly-typed prop API for React components in Dart can be a pain if you do it from scratch.

The most straightforward way to adhere to React patterns is to use Maps for `props` and `state`. One way of accomplishing that is defining typed getters and setters on `MapView`-like classes which proxy Map key-value pairs.

Typing these getters/setters (especially if you namespace the keys), however, can be tedious:

```dart
class FooProps extends UiProps {
  String get title               => props['FooProps.title'];
  set title(String value)        => props['FooProps.title'] = value;

  bool get isEnabled             => props['FooProps.isEnabled'];
  set isEnabled(bool value)      => props['FooProps.isEnabled'] = value;

  MouseEventCallback get onClick => props['FooProps.onClick'];
  set onClick(Callback value)    => props['FooProps.onClick'] = value;

  // ...
}
```

With the transformer, you can cut down on that repetitive code. Props/state are declared using fields, leaving the actual code you write much simpler:

```dart
@Props()
class FooProps extends UiProps {
  String title;

  bool isEnabled;

  MouseEventCallback onClick;

  // ...
}
```

The same can be done for state:

```dart
@State()
class FooState extends UiState {
  bool isShown;

  String currentText;

  // ...
}
```

For more info, see the component declaration [examples].

## Debugging with the diff view
The `web_skin_dart` transformer provides a diff view for each transformed file, which you can use to see how exactly your source files are modified.

When in debug mode (`pub serve`, not `pub build`), this diff is accessible by appending `.diff.html` to the URL of your Dart file.

The easiest way to view it:

1. Open the Dartium developer tools.
2. In the "Source" tab, open the desired file (you can use `âŒ˜P` to search).
3. Right-click in the file's text and select "Open Link in New Tab".
4. Append `.diff.html` to the url in the newly opened tab.
